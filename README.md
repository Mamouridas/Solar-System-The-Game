# Solar-System-The-Game
Beta Version of a university project in Unity

Goal of the game is to destroy all the planets orbiting the sun by launching meteorites on them and achieve the highest score possible

Every time you hit a target, the planet explodes into small pieces and if a piece hit another planet it explodes too.
For every successful hit you get 100 points (+Bonus if you destroy 2 or more planets with one shot) and for every missed shot you lose 50 points, and you also lose 50 points
everytime your body hits a planet or the sun

Controls:
mouse - look around
w - move forward
a - move left
s - move backwards
d - move right
spacebar - launch meteorite
shift - run
q - move higher
e - move lower
l - lock camera (cursor unlocks)
u - unlock camera (locks cursor in center and disappears it)


The game does not contain menu or a restart feature yet, so if you want to play again you have to close the window and re-open it.
In the future I am going to add menu, a restart button and some easter eggs.
